            <h2>Loyal Supporters of Skellefteå and Luleå Hockey</h2>
            <p>
              At <strong>Your Company</strong>, we’re not just passionate about web design—we’re also devoted fans of our local ice hockey teams. Half of us proudly cheer for Skellefteå AIK, while the other half supports Luleå HF, which leads to some lively, friendly banter at the office (especially during derby days!). But no matter which team comes out on top, we all come together to bring the same level of passion and dedication to your projects.
